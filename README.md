# Class Scheduler

**Save college students time and stress by creating a personalized class schedule.**

Our product concept is to create a website to help students plan out their college schedule. We will take the different possibilities for classes as input by scraping different college's online data. We will also ask our users what they want to optimize for. For example, some students may want to keep their Fridays free of any classes. Some students may want to bunch their classes together, while others may want a couple hours between each class. We will start by only working with Drexel's quarter system and slowly expand to semester schools. Ultimately, our goal is to save time and reduce stress for college students with busy schedules and want to get the most out of college.
